Project: SecondSelf — Your Personal AI Second Brain
ProblemStatement.md
Every notes app fails the same way: you capture hundreds of notes, bookmarks, PDFs, and
ideas — and then you never find them again. Information goes in, but nothing comes back out.
Notes sit in folders nobody re-reads. Bookmarks pile up unread. Knowledge doesn't compound.
Goal: Build an end-to-end system where you can capture anything (a note, a link, a file), have AI
automatically classify and file it, auto-link it to related knowledge, render it as a live interactive
graph you can explore, and — most importantly — ask it any question in plain English and get an
answer synthesized from your own accumulated knowledge. Then deploy it to a public URL
anyone can open.
Not a notes app. Not a chatbot. A brain that organizes itself and answers for you.

Final System (what you're building over 4 weeks)
Capture any note/link/file
 ↓
AI classifies & files it (PARA method)
 ↓
AI auto-links it to related notes (embeddings)
 ↓
Everything renders as a live, interactive, hoverable graph
 ↓
Ask it anything in plain English → answer pulled from YOUR notes
 ↓
Deployed on a public URL anyone can open
Week-by-Week Problem Statements
Each week is a self-contained problem. Build it, test it on real data (your own notes — not test
data), and each week's output becomes the next week's input.

Week 1 — The Archivist: "Capture Everything, Lose Nothing"
Problem
You have no single place to put things. Ideas, links, and notes scatter across apps, browser tabs,
and your memory. Build the foundation: one command that captures anything into one place.
Build
1. Set up the project structure from scratch:
○ raw/ — where every raw capture lands
○ wiki/ — (used later) organized, linked notes
2. Write a Python capture script that takes any note, link, or file and saves it into raw/ with:
○ a timestamp
○ a unique ID
○ the raw content
3. Test it on 10+ real pieces of your own scattered information.
Deliverable ("Ship the Capture Pipeline")
● A working capture script — one command saves anything to raw/ with timestamp +
unique ID.
● Your raw/ folder populated with 10+ real captured items (not test data).
● 🏅 Badge: The Archivist
Acceptance Criteria
● [ ] raw/ and wiki/ folder structure exists
● [ ] One command captures a note, a link, AND a file
● [ ] Every capture has a timestamp + unique ID
● [ ] 10+ real items captured

Week 2 — The Librarian: "Teach AI to Organize For You"
Problem
A pile of raw captures is still a mess. Manual tagging never happens. Make the AI do the filing —
and make it notice when two notes are about the same thing and link them automatically.
Build
2.1 — Auto-Classify (The Sorting Hat)
● Write a function that sends any raw capture to a free LLM (Groq / Llama 3) and gets
back:
○ a category (using the PARA framework: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
○ tags
○ a one-line summary
● Run it across last week's real captures and watch them organize themselves.
2.2 — Auto-Link Related Notes (Connect the Dots)
● Compute embeddings for each note (sentence-transformers, local + free).
● Compare each new capture against existing notes in wiki/.
● When content is related (similarity above a threshold), auto-insert a link between them.
● No manual tagging — the system notices relationships on its own.
Deliverable ("Ship the Self-Organizing Wiki")
● A pipeline that auto-classifies raw captures with PARA and auto-links related notes.
● Run on 15+ real items → an organized wiki/ folder with linked notes.
● 🏅 Badge: The Librarian
Acceptance Criteria
● [ ] Any raw capture → category + tags + summary automatically
● [ ] PARA categorization working
● [ ] Embeddings computed per note
● [ ] Related notes auto-linked (no manual tagging)
● [ ] Runs on 15+ real items → organized wiki/

Week 3 — The Cartographer: "Visualize the Brain"
Problem
Your knowledge is now organized and linked — but you can't see it. Turn the wiki into something
you can actually look at, explore, and watch think.
Build
3.1 — Graph Data Model (Give It a Shape)
● Write a script that reads every note and its links.
● Build a nodes-and-edges representation in memory:
○ every note → a node
○ every relationship/link → an edge
● Export it as clean JSON.
3.2 — Interactive Graph (The Brain Comes Alive)
● Use a JS graph library (vis-network or Cytoscape.js) to render:
○ notes as nodes (that pulse / are visually alive)
○ links as edges
○ hover popups that reveal each note's content
○ drag-to-explore and zoom
● A force-directed graph of your own knowledge.
Deliverable ("Ship the Living Brain")
● Your wiki converted to a graph and rendered as an interactive visual brain (hover, drag,
zoom), built from your real notes.
● 🏅 Badge: The Cartographer
Acceptance Criteria
● [ ] Script builds nodes + edges from notes and exports clean JSON
● [ ] Interactive force-directed graph renders from that JSON
● [ ] Hover reveals note content
● [ ] Drag + zoom work
● [ ] Built from your real notes, not dummy data

Week 4 — The Oracle: "Ask It Anything, Ship It Public"
Problem
A visual brain is beautiful, but the real payoff is answers. Wire up natural-language search over
everything you know — then package the whole thing into one deployable product.
Build
4.1 — Ask Your Brain (Natural Language Search)
● Build a single ask() function that combines:
○ the embeddings (find relevant notes to a question)
○ the wiki (the source content)
○ an LLM (synthesize an answer from retrieved notes)
● This is retrieval-augmented Q&A over your own knowledge.
● Test against real questions about your own captured notes.
4.2 — UI, Deployment, Public URL (Give It a Face)
● Assemble everything into one Streamlit app:
○ the interactive brain graph
○ the ask-anything search bar
● Deploy to a free platform (Streamlit Cloud / HF Spaces).
● Get a public URL anyone can open.
Deliverable ("Ship SecondSelf" — the final product)
Deploy the complete system — capture → auto-classify → auto-link → live interactive graph →
ask-anything search — all wired into one Streamlit app with a public URL.
● 🏅 Badge: The Oracle
Acceptance Criteria
● [ ] ask() returns answers synthesized from your own notes (retrieval + LLM)
● [ ] One Streamlit app contains both the graph and the search bar
● [ ] Deployed live with a public URL
● [ ] Full pipeline works end to end in the deployed app


Final Deliverables (whole project)
● [ ] Public GitHub repo with a clean README + setup instructions
● [ ] Live deployed URL — interactive graph + ask-your-brain search, both working
● [ ] End-to-end flow verified: capture → classify → link → graph → ask
● [ ] All 4 weekly milestones complete (Capture Pipeline, Self-Organizing Wiki, Living Brain,
SecondSelf deployment)
